# Various Scripting Projects

### By Jeshwin Prince

Here lies a collection of various scripting projects, both completed and
unfinished, copied code and original ideas, that all come to rest.

These various projects include...

## ⚠ Raspberry Pi Joystick

I wanted to control the color of an RGB LED using a Raspberry Pi with a
joystick as the input. Through this project I learned about converting
to polar coordinates in Python and the differences in RGB color channels.

## ✅ Arch Linux Instructions

To better understand how to install Arch Linux from scratch, I created my own
personal guide on how anyone can install their own Arch Linux virtual
machine the same way I did. At the time, I used LightDM for the display manager,
AwesomeWM for the window manager, and GRUB as a bootloader.
Nowadays, I prefer using Debian-based distros for extra stability,
specifically Pop_OS! for its cosmic version of GNOME. Highly recommend!

## ✅ Cargo Mod Visualizer

These are a pair of simple scripts that act as aliases for `cargo modules`.
I find the tool useful to quickly create an image of my mod tree for Rust projects.

## ✅ Longest Seven Segment Word

Inspired by a Tom Scott video, I created a short python script that finds the
longest word in the English dictionary that can be reasonably printed on
a line of seven segment displays. It was a simple dive into using regex.

## ✅ Gitoken

Quick script to put my Github Personal Access Token into my clipboard.
This makes pushing to my repos easier.
